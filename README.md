In preperation for all the Interviews, I started doing the exercises

I started out using c++ but after having experiencing all the overflows and focusing on those problems more than the problems I had to solve I switched to Typescript because in JS every number is a float except BigInt but encountering those is rather rare.
Maybe I will make same time and convert them to rust and c++
